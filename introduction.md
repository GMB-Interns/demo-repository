# Intro & Background

My name is Ruddy, and I couldn't be more excited to join the GetMotivatedBuddies team as an intern. Currently, I'm soaking up knowledge while pursuing my Master's in Applied Data Science @ University of San Diego, and I bring three years of experience working as a Data Analyst and Business Intelligence Developer.

Data science is not just a field of study for me, but a true passion. I have a strong interest in machine learning and predictive modeling, and I'm always eager to explore new techniques and expand my understanding of data.

Joining GetMotivatedBuddies is an opportunity that aligns perfectly with my interests. I'm keen on using my skills to help develop more efficient user matching algorithms, predict user needs more accurately, and generate insights to boost user engagement and satisfaction.

I'm genuinely excited about working with all the talented data scientists and developers on this team. I look forward to contributing my skills and learning from all of you.

What really fires me up about this journey is the chance to use data to make a significant impact on people's lives. I believe that data science can be a powerful tool in motivating and inspiring personal growth, and I'm thrilled to be part of that.

And yes, I actively use ChatGPT-4 for my projects. I'm a believer in the potential of this groundbreaking technology to boost our productivity and enhance the accuracy of our decision-making. Recently, I've started using the OpenAI API tool for automating certain tasks. It's an exciting tool that has already proven invaluable, and I'm looking forward to exploring its capabilities further during my time at GMB.
