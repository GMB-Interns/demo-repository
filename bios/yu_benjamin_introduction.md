# Introduction
Hi everyone! I am Benjamin Yu, a freshman at UC Santa Barbara, majoring in Applied Mathematics, and I will be transferring to UCLA next fall. I'm really excited on the opportunity to join the team as an Intern.

# Education Background: 
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Science in Applied Mathematics at UCLA, though I am attempting to transfer my major to Data Theory, as it better aligns with my passions.

# Technical Skills: 
I possess a valuable set of technical skills ranging from programming languages such as a proficiency in Java, Python (Pandas, numpy, Scikit-Learn), R, MATLAB, and SQL, to a proficiency in Microsoft Office Tools.

# Professional Experience: 
I have previous professional experience as an Engineering Intern, where I was primary tasked with the collection and analysis of data for the company's chips. Though I was unable to develop my data analysis skills much there, I was able to develop my soft skills with the company. As the company was a startup comany, many of the tasks I was assigned were not initially apart of my responsibilities. I had to be very adaptable, learning new skills on the fly in order to match the company's needs. 
 
# Vision and Approach: 
As an intern for GetMotivatedBuddies, I am to use data science skills to further the company's goals. I intend to use data-driven decision making and machine learning techniques to develop better experiences for users and help them achieve their goals. 

# Why GMB?
GetMotivatedBuddies is a perfect opportunity for me to work with data to gather experience in developing more efficient user matching algorithms and predict user needs. I'm very excited to work with the data scientists and developers on this team to learn and develop my abilities in Data Science. I think the most exciting thing for me is the ability to work in an enviroment benefitting the lives of others while developing my own abilities. 

# Conclusion: 
I'm very excited about the prospect of joining GetMotivatedBuddies to further develop my abilities and contribute to a company whose primary goal is to help people. With my skills, experience, and willingness to learn, I am confident I can contribute to the success of this company.
